Gauthic provides a Ruby interface to Google's Data APIs. This initial release
has very limited functionality aimed at a specific need I have in an existing
client application.

The library only supports the Shared Contacts API at present because this is my
most pressing need. Read about the Shared Contacts API here:

Authorization is done via ClientLogin. It is my understanding that Oauth is
preferred to ClientLogin, but it was not immediately obvious to me how to get
OAuth working in a detached environment such as is found in a cron job. Read
more about Google Data authorization here:
